Summary
======

My name is Mitchell Humphrey. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Missouri University of Science and Technology.

About Me
=======
I was born in a small town called Bruce Mississippi, around 30 minutes from Oxford. My family moved to Cape Girardeau, Missouri just in time for me to start elementary at Alma Schrader elementary school. I did my entire K-12 education in Cape Girardeau, graduating from Cape Central High School. I was in advanced Math and English classes during my time at Cape Central High School. I was also a member of the Wind Symphony and Jazz Band. For Extracurriculars, I was in the marching band for 2 years, and a member of the wrestling team for 4 years, while being the team captain for my Junior and Senior years.

I started attending the Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&T) during Fall 2018.
